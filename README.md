# `gavin` (Global Action Version INspector)

`gavin` is a tool to inspect, validate, and update the versions of all pipeline actions globally.

With `gavin`, you can specify what version in your organization should be used as the standard version.

`gavin` will then inspect all the actions in your organization and validate if they are using the standard version.

If not, `gavin` will update the version of the action to the standard version.
